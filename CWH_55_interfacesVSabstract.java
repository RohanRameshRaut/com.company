*  Why use interfaces when we have abstract?
* --> As we know Java does not support multiple inheritance (many parents one child).
* --> Abstract class follows the same above rule but interfaces does not follow the above rule
* --> We can create a single implements class from multiple interfaces class
* --> Abstract can have (only one parent many child)
* --> Interfaces can have (many parents many child) like multiple inheritance
* --> Abstract class can contain other methods also
* --> Interfaces can only contain the methods which are important
