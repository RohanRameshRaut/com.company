        /* Is Java Compiled or interpreted?
        * ans: Java is a hybrid language-->both compiled as well as interpreted
        * Compilation process:- Java File(harry.java)---->compiled(using JavaC compiler)--->Class File(harry.class)(class file contains byte code)---->can be used by java interpreter
        * Makers built the Java as platform independent.
        * byte code or class file is a platform independent file means it can run on any platform like MacOs, WindowsOs, LinuxOs etc.
        * Java is both compiled and interpreted language cause its platform independent.
        *
        * Interpretation process:- A JVM(A Java virtual machine(JVM) is a virtual machine that enables a computer to run Java programs as well as programs written in other languages that are also compiled to Java bytecode.)
        * A JVM is an interpreter can be used to Interpret this bytecode.
        * This byteCode can be taken to any platform(Mac, Windows, Linux) for execution
        * Hence java is platform independent (write once run everywhere).
        *
        * Executing a Java Program
        *
        * javac Harry.java --> compiled
        * java Harry.class --> Interpreted
        *
        * So far the execution of our program was being managed by intellij idea.
        * We can download a source code editor like VS Code to compile & execute our Java programs.
